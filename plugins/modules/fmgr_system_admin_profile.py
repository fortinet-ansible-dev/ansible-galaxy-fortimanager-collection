notes:
    - Starting in version 2.4.0, all input arguments are named using the underscore naming convention (snake_case).

      Old argument names are still available yet you will receive deprecation warnings.
      You can ignore this warning by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
    - Running in workspace locking mode is supported in this FortiManager module, the top
      level parameters workspace_locking_adom and workspace_locking_timeout help do the work.
    - To create or update an object, use state present directive.
    - To delete an object, use state absent directive.
    - Normally, running one module can fail when a non-zero rc is returned. you can also override
      the conditions to fail or succeed with parameters rc_failed and rc_succeeded
